## Introduction

As the manager overseeing operations at an internet retail company, my priority is to equip our e-commerce platform with a cutting-edge backend infrastructure. This initiative aims to bolster our competitive edge within the dynamic landscape of online retail, ensuring we remain at the forefront of innovation and efficiency.

## Usage

With the Express.js API fully functional, connecting to the MySQL database using Sequelize is a breeze after adding the necessary credentials to the environment variable file. Now, with the database linked up, running schema and seed commands creates and populates the database with test data, all set for testing and development tasks.

Launching the application spins up our server and seamlessly syncs the Sequelize models with the MySQL database, ensuring smooth data operations. Insomnia Core retrieves data from the API endpoints for categories, products, and tags, beautifully formatted in JSON.

Testing the waters with POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core reveals the power of our backend—we can create, update, and delete data with ease, demonstrating the robustness of our e-commerce backend.
